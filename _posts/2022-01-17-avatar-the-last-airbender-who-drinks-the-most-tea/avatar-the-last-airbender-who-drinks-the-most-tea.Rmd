I do a bit of knitting, which feels comfortably creative because I can follow patterns and not make a single creative decision if I do not feel comfortable. It's been an artistic outlet that has allowed me to lean into my creativity with some structure, which I like and need. This small project felt similar. 

Curious about aRt in R, I decided to watch the [R Ladies Sana Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/) talk with [Ijeamaka Anyene](https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app) titled ["aRt + ggplot: exploring radial visualizations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0i6KAahLY8). I was pleased to find that the concepts were simple enough to try as I watched Ijeamaka share her gorgeous artwork. To me the simple, beautiful effect of adding `+ coord_polar` to my `ggplot` bar graphs was amazing, and something I might not have considered on my own, much like new techniques in a knitting pattern :) 

Like Ijeamaka, I applied the techniques of radial visualizations to [a Tidy Tuesday dataset from 2020 which contains the entire script for the Nickelodeon cartoon series, _Avatar: the Last Airbender._](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-08-11) I search for places where characters talk about tea, group by character to figure out who is doing th most talking about tea, and visualize _"Who drinks the most tea?"_ I tweeted my results and received kind praise from [Ijeamaka via her Twitter](https://twitter.com/ijeamaka_a), which made me feel so COOL! I'm thankful for her generous instruction and aRtistry inspiration! She's made me think harder about communicating data creatively, beautifully, and in unexpected ways!
