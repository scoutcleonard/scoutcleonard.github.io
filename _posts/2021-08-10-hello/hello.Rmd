Hi there and welcome! 

If you're reading this, it means you've found my blog. I am currently learning to create my own website in R, so thanks for your patience as this masterpiece takes shape. 

I plan to use this blog page as a way to record just a tiny fraction of the amazing amount of things I am learning in my masters program. Mainly, it is a way for me to reflect on the work I've done and to improve and reproduce my code. If you find it interesting or helpful, that is a happy plus :) 

Warm regards and happy coding,
Scout
