    "contents": "\nI’m learning lots in Environmental Data Science 221: Scientific Programming Essentials!\nHere are some examples of things I’ve learned so far:\nOne function we’ve learned that I enjoy is the case_when() function. When paired with the mutate() function, we can sort data in a newly created column based on existing data. Below is an example with the Palmer Penguins dataset.\n\n\n\nI made this stacked bar graph so you can see that I have a new column that has two classifications for flipper length: medium and small.\nA concept we’ve learned in EDS 221 is tidy data. As an organizational fiend, this has been one of my favorite concepts! I have worked on many, many untidy spreadsheets over the years. In tidy data, data is organized in a predictable way! Most importantly, tidy data has:\n1.) Each variable is a column. 2.) Each observation is a row. 3.) Each cell contains 1 value.\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

Maybe I’ll exchange for one of my own photos later!\n\n\n\nThis is my scatter plot of penguin body mass to flipper length ratios. I used the Palmer’s Penguins Dataset and ggplot function. I’m still playing around with my blog and am just adding this as an example of what I’ve learned to code this week.
