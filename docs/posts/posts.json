    "contents": "\nI’m learning lots in Environmental Data Science 221: Scientific Programming Essentials!\nHere are some examples of things I’ve learned so far:\nOne function we’ve learned that I enjoy is the case_when() function. When paired with the mutate() function, we can sort data in a newly created column based on existing data. Below is an example with the Palmer Penguins dataset.\n\n\n\nI made this stacked bar graph so you can see that I have a new column that has two classifications for flipper length: medium and small.\nA concept we’ve learned in EDS 221 is tidy data. As an organizational fiend, this has been one of my favorite concepts! I have worked on many, many untidy spreadsheets over the years. In tidy data, data is organized in a predictable way! Most importantly, tidy data has:\n1.) Each variable is a column. 2.) Each observation is a row. 3.) Each cell contains 1 value.\nA thing I have learned about doing data science is that reproducible workflows are essential, and acheived in various ways! Valuing the code over the product (i.e. saving and pushing to repo) is more important that the output (html you knit!). Create a repo and stage, commit, push, pull early and often! Try not to copy and paste code. Be aware of the order in which you put functions. Do not alter your original data set. There are many more, but as you can see, reproducible workflows are essential.\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

I am currently learning to create my own website in R, so thanks for your patience as this masterpiece takes shape.\nI plan to use this blog page as a way to record just a tiny fraction of the amazing amount of things I am learning in my masters program. Mainly, it is a way for me to reflect on the work I’ve done and to improve and reproduce my code. If you find it interesting or helpful, that is a happy plus :)\nWarm regards and happy coding, Scout\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",
