I am pretty sure it’s not kosher to pull images from the internet for my website without citing my source but I am just playing around in R right now. Maybe I’ll exchange for one of my own photos later!\n\n\n\nThis is my scatter plot of penguin body mass to flipper length ratios. I used the Palmer’s Penguins Dataset and ggplot function. I’m still playing around with my blog and am just adding this as an example of what I’ve learned to code this week.
