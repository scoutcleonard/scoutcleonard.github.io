      "contents": "\nScout is a graduate student in the Masters of Environmental Data Science Program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2018, she received her Bachelor‚Äôs Degree from Harvard University, where she studied Integrative Biology and Energy & the Environment. At Harvard, Scout led consulting projects for nonprofit organizations with the Harvard College Conservation Society and conducted ecological research. After an internship in which she managed beehives which reduce human-elephant conflict and protect agriculture, her interest shifted from ecology to human-environmental systems and conservation conflict resolution.\nScout is interested in studying the environment in the complex way that it exists in relationship with human populations. As such, she has spent the last 3 years working on urban food systems in Oakland, California with nonprofit groups No Kid Hungry and FoodCorps. Her work expanded access to healthy school meals for Oakland students. Scout believes that every person has the right to nutritious, culturally-appropriate food. She oversaw food system programs by managing procurement, participation, and waste data;she plans to use data science to transform human-environmental systems, especially food systems, to be more sustainable and equitable.\n\n\n\n",
