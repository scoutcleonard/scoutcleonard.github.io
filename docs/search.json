      "contents": "\nScout Leonard is a recent graduate of the Masters of Environmental Data Science\nprogram at the Bren School at the University of California Santa\nBarbara. Currently, she is a fellow with the Stanford University Data Science for Social Good\nProgram. Scout is passionate about data visualization and open,\nreproducible data science.\n\n\n\nScout graduated from Harvard College in 2018 with her BA in\nIntegrative Biology and minor in Energy and the Environment. During\ncollege, Scout led consulting projects for nonprofits such as the Planetary\nHealth Alliance as a project leader in the Harvard College\nConservation Society. She also conducted research with Professor Brian Farrell on\nisland endemism and plant phylogenetics.\n\n\n\nSupported by the Weissman Fellowship, Scout created apiary management\nsystems for forest-edge hives in Kibale National Forest, Uganda, with\nthe Kasiisi Project. These\n“beehive-fences” have conservation, economic, and social benefits, even\nto this day; they reduce human-elephant conflict and provide income to\nfarmers. This project inspired Scout’s interest in multidisciplinary\nsustainability projects, particularly those that emphasize environmental\njustice.\n\n\n\nAs such, Scout has spent the last 3 years working on urban food\nsystems in Oakland, California with No Kid Hungry and FoodCorps. She oversaw food system\nprograms by managing procurement, participation, and waste data across\nthe city; Scout believes that every person has the right to nutritious\nfood, and her work expanded access to healthy school meals for Oakland.\nUsing data science, Scout hopes to transform human-environmental systems\nto be more sustainable and equitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
