### Hi and welcome! 

I am a Data Analyst II in [<span style="color: #436857;">Oakland Unified School District's (OUSD)</span>](https://www.ousd.org/domain/4) [<span style="color: #436857;">Research, Assessment, and Data department</span>](https://www.ousd.org/domain/3307). In my role, I support the District's Community Schools and Student Services (CSSS) Department. Community Schools are full service sites that support students with an integrated approach to academics, public health, social services, and community development. I always want my work to contribute toward projects that support an equitable, joyful, and sustainable future, and so CSSS is a meaningful place to be. 

I am a recent graduate of the [<span style="color: #436857;">Masters of Environmental Data Science</span>](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. I also recently concluded my fellowship with [<span style="color: #436857;">Stanford University's Data Science for Social Good Program</span>](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program). My team at Stanford utilized modeling methods to elucidate factors contributing to U.S. excess mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level. 

When I'm not knitting markdowns, I knit IRL; fellow Ravelers, you can see my work at the link to [<span style="color: #436857;">my Ravelry page</span>](https://www.ravelry.com/people/scoutcleonard).
