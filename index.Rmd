### Hi and welcome! 

I am a Data Analyst in [<span style="color: #436857;">Oakland Unified School District's (OUSD)</span>](https://www.ousd.org/domain/4) [<span style="color: #436857;">Research, Assessment, and Data department</span>](https://www.ousd.org/domain/3307). I am returning to the district after graduate school, and I previously served Oakland students through programming in OUSD's Nutrition Services and Health and Wellness departments. OUSD has many programs and departments that support all of the different needs of students and community members. I feel excited to support the data needs of many professionals who, like me, are commited to serving the whole child! 
 
I am a recent graduate of the [<span style="color: #436857;">Masters of Environmental Data Science</span>](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. I also recently concluded my fellowship with [<span style="color: #436857;">Stanford University's Data Science for Social Good Program</span>](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program). My team at Stanford utilized modeling methods to elucidate factors contributing to U.S. excess mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level. 

When I'm not knitting markdowns, I knit IRL; fellow Ravelers, you can see my work at the link to [<span style="color: #436857;">my Ravelry page</span>](https://www.ravelry.com/people/scoutcleonard).
