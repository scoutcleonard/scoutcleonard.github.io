### Welcome to my personal website! 
 
I am a  graduate student in the <span style="color: #436857;">Masters of Environmental Data Science</span> program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. My previous work includes multidisciplinary roles in nonprofit organizations prioritizing environmental justice.

When I'm not knitting markdowns, I knit IRL; you can see my work at the link to my Ravelry page.
