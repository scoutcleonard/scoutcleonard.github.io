### Hi and welcome! 
 
I am a recent graduate of the [<span style="color: #436857;">Masters of Environmental Data Science</span>](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. My previous work includes multidisciplinary roles in nonprofit organizations prioritizing environmental justice, especially food justice.

Currently, I am fellow with [<span style="color: #436857;">Stanford University's Data Science for Social Good Program</span>](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program). My team at Stanford is utilizing modeling methods to elucidate factors contributing to U.S. excess mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level. 

When I'm not knitting markdowns, I knit IRL; fellow Ravelers, you can see my work at the link to [<span style="color: #436857;">my Ravelry page</span>](https://www.ravelry.com/people/scoutcleonard).
