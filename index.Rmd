### Hi and welcome! 
 
I am a graduate student in the [<span style="color: #436857;">Masters of Environmental Data Science</span>](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara. My previous work includes multidisciplinary roles in nonprofit organizations prioritizing environmental justice, especially food justice.

When I'm not knitting markdowns, I knit IRL; fellow Ravelers, you can see my work at the link to my Ravelry page.
